This project is part of the YouTube Academic Projects Series by Spartificial Innovations Pvt Ltd. It focuses on the application of Machine Learning to classify astronomical objects as stars, galaxies, or quasars using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR14 dataset.

## Project ID: PSGQ0922

## Project Workflow

1. **Introduction to the Dataset**
2. **Importing Necessary Libraries and Modules**
3. **Exploring the Dataset**
4. **Preparing Data for the Model**
5. **Scaling the Data and Checking Distribution Plots**
6. **Building the ML Models and Checking Results**

## About the Problem & Dataset

### Astronomical Objects:

- **Galaxy**: A gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. Galaxies are categorized as elliptical, spiral, or irregular based on their morphology.
  
- **Star**: A luminous spheroid of plasma held together by gravity. The Sun is the nearest star to Earth.

- **Quasar**: An extremely luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), radiating enormous power. Quasars are among the brightest objects in the universe.

### Dataset:

The dataset used is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR14, containing 10,000 observations described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column. The class column categorizes the observations as either a star, galaxy, or quasar. The dataset is split into 70% training and 30% testing subsets.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries:
